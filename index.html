     <section id="about">
    <p>I like coding. Coding makes me happy. For me, Coding is the thing that make me feel more creative. It also is the only hobby that also gets more fun as I learn it better. I do some coding bs everyday, whether it's WhiteHatJr or just fun coding. I usually spend 30 min on coding, to keep getting better at it. I think coding is very fun and easy, provided you have put some time into using it. To me, I always liked learning the underlying structure, and coding let me do just that.</p>

       <p>Aside from coding, I like to plaay video games. Video games are very fun and the help me relax after a stressful week. They also help me improve my focus. Along with coding, video games help me spark some ideas. These ideas also allow me to code for it and make thing existing ideas better.</p>
