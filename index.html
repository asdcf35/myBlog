     <section id="about">
    <p>I like coding. Coding makes me happy. For me, Coding is the thing that make me feel more creative. It also is the only hobby that also gets more fun as I learn it better. I do some coding everyday, whether it's WhiteHatJr or just fun coding. I usually spend 30 min on coding, to keep getting better at it. I think coding is very fun and easy, provided you have put some time into using it. To me, I always liked learning the underlying structure, and coding let me do just that.</p>
